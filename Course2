Pawan Dubey
Dynamic Programming
Understanding the prolem and implementing a solution which is space and time efficient by structuring it into sub problems.


Manisha Shedge
Divide and Conquer Algorithms
This technique can be broken down into three sections:
Divide: This entails breaking the problem down into smaller chunks.
Conquer: Recursively solve sub-problems until they're all solved.
Combine the sub-issues to achieve the overall problem's final answer.
